# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to winapps! Before you can contribute, we ask some things of you:

- Please follow our Code of Conduct, the Contributor Covenant. You can find a copy in this repository or under https://www.contributor-covenant.org/
- All Contributors have to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin, agreeing to license their contribution under the AGPLv3. Historically, we used to require a CLA because we had to relicense the codebase from ARR to AGPLv3; however, this is being phased out. You can find a copy of the DCO below or under https://developercertificate.org/.
- Please follow code conventions enforced by `pre-commit`. To keep down CI usage, please run it locally before committing too.
  See <https://pre-commit.com> for installation, then run `pre-commit install` inside the `winapps` repository you cloned.

## Guidelines for pre-defined applications

Some pre-defined applications contain a header like:

This is for historic reasons, see [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) and [COPYRIGHT.md](../COPYRIGHT.md).  
When contributing new applications, please *do not* include such a header.
