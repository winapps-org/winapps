## Pre-commit

pre-commit is a tool which allows to run checks before committing.
It is recommended to install it and run it before committing, since the same checks
are run through github actions on pull request. We will not merge a pull request unless all checks pass.

Installation instructions can be found here: https://pre-commit.com/#install <br>
After installing, run `pre-commit install` in the repository root to install the git hooks.

It is recommended to run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing to make sure all checks pass.  It is also recommended to use the git cli since graphical git solutions do not always play well with pre-commit.
